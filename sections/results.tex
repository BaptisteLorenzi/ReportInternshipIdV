\section{Results}

Here, we investigated fast adaptation in the mouse retina under natural
stimulus conditions. To this end, we trained a CNN model on RGC responses to a
movie of flashed images appearing naturally in the mouse environment, % and then performed a model-guided
% search for stimuli that maximize the responses of RGCs.

\textbf{A method to estimate how selectivity to natural images changes over time.}
We recorded retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in the mouse retina with multi-electrode arrays (MEAs) while displaying sequences of natural images.
Each image was presented for 400 ms, preceded by one of three 400 ms adaptation light patterns: grey, checkerboard, or inverted checkerboard ADD FIG SUMMARY OR ID CARD.
Each pair of adaptation patterns and natural images forms a stimulus clip lasting 800 ms.
To measure the selectivity of RGC to different parts of the image, we added dim checkerboard patterns (Figure \ref{fig:LSTA}).
The amplitude of the perturbation checkerboard was selected to introduce a small yet visible change in the RGC response compared to the RGD response to the unperturbed natural image.
1000 repetitions with different perturbation patterns were necessary to estimate the LSTA to one clip (see Methods).

For each cell and each stimulus clip, we computed ane estimation of a local
spike-trigger average (LSTA) (Figure \ref{LSTA}), as the average of the
perturbation patterns weighted by the number of splikes they evoked. This
estimation is similar to a more classical Spike Trigger Average (STA), but due
to the small amplitude of the perturbation checkerboard, we explore here a
small, local region of the stimulus space centered on the reference natural
image. The LSTA is a visualization of the gradient of the RGC response at the
reference natural image point in stimulus space. From an experimental point of
view, instead of perturbating the biological system itself (e.g. shutting down
neuronal pathways), we perturbated the stimulus itself.

We recorded RGC responses from four different eyes. The first experiment was
discarded since 750 repetitions were not sufficient to estimate the LSTA. The
second experiment was also discarded since the retina was very unhealthy during
the recordings. The third experiment was a great success with over 100 cells
showing relevant LSTA for many different clips. Finally, we used a fourth
experiment to both train and test our model and measure LSTA, once again with
great success with about 100 cells with LSTAs despite the longer experimental
time.

\par~\textbf{Ganglion cells can change their selectivity depending on previous
    light patterns.}

We looked at the firing rate and the LSTA of more than 200 cells changed
depending on the adaptation light pattern. Some clear hypotheses can be made as
described in Figure \ref{fig:CellExample}.

It seems that in most cases, the displacement of the LSTA could be explained by
the biphasic temporal dynamic of units if the LNLN model. For instance, if ON
bipolar cells are probed with white, they could be in the negative phase of their
biphasic responses when the natural image appears which would reduce their
response. As a chained consequence, the associated RGC will receive less
excitation from that part of the image, which would cause the displacement of
the LSTA. Still, a single RGC can behave differently depending on the content
of the natural image, which would not be captured by a LNLN model with fixed
parameters.

We have yet to do a statistical analysis of the number of occurrences of those
different behavior.

\textbf{Can a convolutional neural network model account for this dependance?}

We trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to predict the RGC
response to natural images. We hope to infer some of the governing
non-linearities in the recorded RGC. We expect the CNN model to have
good test performance on clips using the gray adaptation since it is trained on
such data However it's unclear how it will generalize to the other two
adaptation patterns. Additional divisive dynamics such as gain control would
have to be added to the model. More on model design can be found in Methods and Appendix.

Here, we will show the results obtained from one of our model.

First, as we expected, the model predicted the clip using the gray adaptation
better and mostly fails in the other two cases. Notice that in most cases it
did predict a response but did not account for the new delay (Figure \ref*{}).
This hints at temporal dynamics being not well encoded in the CNN model.

However, test performances are not enough to validate a model that can be used
to build a hypothesis on the retinal code. We also have to make sure that the
model learns its filters to look like those of retinal cells. In te subunit,
we expect a center/surround spatial filter with a biphasic temporal filter. In
the RGC, we expect a localized receptive field, preferentially with a
center/surround spatial filter with a biphasic temporal filter. AS shown in
Figure \ref ;;;, while the chosen model have a localized RGC receptive field
with a slightly biphasic temporal filter, it lacks a clear surround in the filter
of its subunits. As a consequence of the filters being too smalls, there are
large discontinuities on the border of the subunit filters that are not
desirable.
The structure of the filters is influenced by the L1 and L2 regularization that are difficult to find tuned.

Finally, we would like to know if the CNN model can predict the displacement of
the LSTA observed before. We computed the LSTA as the average gradient of the
model over the frame of the stimulus that contained the natural image. It seems
that the current model is not able to predict this displacement. This could
indicate that it is structurally can't learn them, which would go in favor of
extending the model with more complex temporal dynamics such as gain control.
But it could also mean that the model was not properly trained.

    \caption{\textbf{PSTH and LSTA depend on previous light patterns: some exemplary RGCs.} \textbf{Left} Poststimulus time histograms (PSTH) are histograms of the times at which neurons fire. In each plot, the time bins in grey correspond to the display of an adaptation pattern while time bins in white natural images.
        The time axis is centered on the moment when the current natural image is displayed. So in order the four rectangles are the previous natural image, current adaptation pattern, current natural image, and next adaptation pattern. The area highlighted in yellow corresponds to the 400 ms windows over which spikes are integrated to compute the LSTA. Adaptation effects can already be seen there, the firing rate of the RGC can be modified by the adaptation pattern.
        Each color corresponds to a different 'previous natural image' displayed 800ms before the current natural image. We noticed that it influenced the response of the RGC to the current natural image. After looking at all the path of all the cells, we judged that it was minor enough to not impact the behavior of the RGC that we want to visualize. Longer time windows would reduce the number of repetation that can be shown in a set amount of time and reduce the quality of the estimation of the LSTA.
        \textbf{Right} Local Spike Triggered Average (LSTA), average of the perturbation checkerboard patterns weighted by the number of spikes they evoked. Here we centered the view on the RGC receptive field and smoothed the LSTA using exponential tuning and spatial interpolation. We observed dependence on the adaptation pattern in On (Cell 1 ...), Off (Cell 2) and OnOff cells (Cell 3). A first hypothesis would be that for On cells, an area that stays white provoke less response that an area that goes from black in the adaptation pattern to white in the natural image - respectively black for Off cells (On Cell - Column ...).
        However, this hypothesis does not hold true in all cases (jjj). For OnOff cell, this adaptation can happen in both pathways simultaneously (cell OnOff). We observed that a high spiking rate was not necessarily linked with a clearly defined LSTA and vice-versa. }
