Some idea of speech: *** responses of exemplary RGCs


Here, we investigated fast adaptation in the mouse retina under natural
stimulus conditions. To this end, we trained a CNN model on RGC responses
to a movie of flashed images appearing
naturally in the mouse environment, % and then performed a model-guided
% search for stimuli that maximise the responses of RGCs.
