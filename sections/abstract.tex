    We trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) model on large-scale
    functional recordings of RGC responses to natural mouse movies, and then
    used
    this model to investigate the role of past images in the activity of RGC.

    Our work showcases how a combination of experiments with natural stimuli
    and computational modelling allows discovering ...
