\textit{During my internship in Olivier Marre's team at l'Institut de la
    Vision, I am
    focusing on computational modeling of the retina. Olivier Marre's team is
    an
    interdisciplinary laboratory, hosting four professors and a dozen of
    interns,
    Ph.D. students and post-docs, working hand in hand to advance research
    on the retina. They all have various backgrounds mainly from biology,
    theoretical physics and engineering. In the context of this project, I've
    been
    working
    closely with Samuele Virgili, a third-year Ph.D. student, whose previous
    and
    current projects all focus on the modeling of retinal ganglion cells.}

\textit{I would like to thanks Olivier and Samuele for their kind supervision
    as well as the whole team for their
    warm welcome.}
