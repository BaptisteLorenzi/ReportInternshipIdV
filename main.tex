% Users of the {thebibliography} environment or BibTeX should use the
% scicite.sty package, downloadable from *Science* at
% http://www.sciencemag.org/authors/preparing-manuscripts-using-latex 
% This package should properly format in-text

% The preamble here sets up a lot of new/revised commands and
% environments.  It's annoying, but please do *not* try to strip these
% out into a separate .sty file (which could lead to the loss of some
% information when we convert the file to other formats).  Instead, keep
% them in the preamble of your main LaTeX source file.


% The following parameters seem to provide a reasonable page setup.

\topmargin 0.0cm
\oddsidemargin 0.2cm
\textwidth 16cm 
\textheight 21cm
\footskip 1.0cm


%The next command sets up an environment for the abstract to your paper.

\newenvironment{sciabstract}{%
\begin{quote} \bf}
{\end{quote}}



% Include your paper's title here

\title{Rapid dynamics in the retina} 


% Place the author information here.  Please hand-code the contact
% information and notecalls; do *not* use \footnote commands.  Let the
% author contact information appear immediately below the author names
% as shown.  We would also prefer that you don't change the type-size
% settings shown here.

\author

% Include the date command, but leave its argument blank.
